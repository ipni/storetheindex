> The first place to go in order to find a CID stored in Filecoin

This repo provides an indexer implementation that can be used to index data stored by a range of participating storage providers.

## Design
- [IPNI: InterPlanetary Network Indexer](https://github.com/ipni/specs/blob/main/IPNI.md#ipni-interplanetary-network-indexer)

## Current Status
Released for production: The current production release is running at https://cid.contact 

This project and is currently under active development 🚧.  

## Install
This assumes go is already installed.

Install storetheindex:
```sh
go install github.com/ipni/storetheindex@latest
```

Initialize the storetheindex repository and configuration:
```sh
storetheindex init
```

Optionally, edit the configuration
```sh
edit ~/.storetheindex/config 
```

## Running the Indexer Service
To run storetheindex as a service, run the `daemon` command. The service watches for providers to index, and exposes a query / content routing client interface.

The daemon is configured by the config file in the storetheindex repository. The config file and repo are created when storetheindex is initialized, using the `init` command. This repo is located in the local file system. By default, the repo is located at ~/.storetheindex. To change the repo location, set the `$STORETHEINDEX_PATH` environmental variable.

## Provider Removal Policy
After a configured amount of time without any updates from a provider (`PollInterval`), the indexer will poll the provider at its last know publisher address, for any index updates. If there is no response from the provider after at least one attempt to poll, then the provider is considered inactive and is not returned in any find results. The indexer will continue polling on an interval (`PollRetryAfter`) until a time limit (`PollStopAfter`) is reached. If there is still no response to the poll attempts after this time limit is reached, then the provider is removed from the indexer and its records are garbage-collected and will need to be refetched. 

The configuration values that control this are documented [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipni/storetheindex/config#Discovery), and their default values are specified [here](https://github.com/ipni/storetheindex/blob/main/doc/config.md#discovery). A custom polling configuration may be applied for specific providers using the `PollOverrides` configuration value to specify per-provider [Polling configuration](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipni/storetheindex/config#Polling).

## Indexer CLI Commands
There are a number of client commands included with storetheindex. Their purpose is to perform simple indexing and lookup actions against a running daemon.  These can be helpful to test that an indexer is working. These include the following commands:

Informational:

- `find` Find value by CID or multihash in indexer
- `providers` Show information about providers known to the indexer
  - `get` Get information about a specified provider
  - `list` List the known providers

Administrative:

- `admin` Perform admin activities with an indexer
  - `allow` Allow advertisements and content from peer
  - `block` Block advertisements and content from peer
  - `import-providers` Import provider information from another indexer
  - `reload-config` Reload various settings from the configuration file
  - `sync` Sync indexer with provider
- `init` Initialize or upgrade indexer node config file

Testing:

- `import` Imports data to indexer from different sources
- `register` Register provider information with an indexer
- `synthetic` Generate synthetic load to import in indexer
