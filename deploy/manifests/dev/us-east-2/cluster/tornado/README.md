# Tornado

This directory contains a `tornado` _cluster-level_ Flux tenancy configuration that
creates a K8S namespace dedicated to the Bedrock Tornado team, along with all Flux CRDs to set up and manage
continuous delivery for Tornado applications.

Note that the [_application
level_ manifests](https://github.com/filecoin-project/tornado-deploy/tree/main/deploy/manifests/dev/us-east-2)
are located in a seperate repo.
